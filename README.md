# Ye
Ye (yoruba for "explore") is an augmented reality application that enables you so point your smartphone camera on a S-Bahn map in Berlin and get additional information right away on the phone, as if the map comes alive.

## Supported Platforms
For now only Android 4.0 and up are supported. Further ressources for developing an iOS or Windows Phone Version will be reqested based on the feedback for the upcomming release of the Android version.

## Download
The App is stil in development. So a download is not available right now. As soon as the development is finished, we will perform a closed beta test with a limited amount of people. If you want to be one of the first to try out this app, you can follow us on twitter to get the latest news. When the closed beta starts, we will give some of our followers a download link to the app (Please note that the first version of the app will only work with the public transprtation map in Berlin).
